      <p><h5>Screws and Nut, Lock nuts, Washers, Lock washers</h5>
	We use American standard screws, nuts and bolts and not british standard. Most of the components like motors, etc have threading on american standard. So, always but american standard nuts and bolts. Though american standard nuts and bolts are difficult to get in Kanpur, Sachdeva hardware in Gumti No. 5 is a reliable shop for such stuff. You can reach Gumti by a Vikram auto.
