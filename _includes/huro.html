          The <b>Humanoid-Robot</b> project or <b>HURO</b> as we call it, is an effort by the students of IITK to enter into and make a contribution to the world of autonomous robotics. The team which consists of thirteen 2nd year and five 3rd year students aims to make a humanoid robot capable of performing various pre-determined athletic tasks as required by the <b>FIRA-HURO</b> cup.<br><br> We have our <b>Machine-Learning</b> sub team working to provide tons of autonomous features to our robot and our <b>Voice-Localization</b> sub team working on a module which we plan to incorporate into our robot down the lane. We also have our <b>Simulation</b> team for making sure the algorithms run well and as expected, before actually running them on the main robot, also designing efficient algorithms for stable walking and control for our robotic system and our <b>Battery-Management-System (BMS)</b> team to optimize utilization of resources. We also use <b>ROS (Robot OS)</b> one of the best framework for writing robot software.
