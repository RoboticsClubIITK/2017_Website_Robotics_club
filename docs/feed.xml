&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The October was spent in understanding the problem statement, design rules, reading previous year design reports of participated teams and news forums. A basic construct I understood was that we were supposed to build an autonomous vehicle. Daily, we read the news about Tesla Autopilot, Driverless Car, Volvo Drive Me spending billions to make our autonomous car future a reality. Hence, the objective of this problem excited me. There were several modules on which one could work on. It was Localization and Mapping, Lane Detection, Motion Planning and Control. It wasn’t tough for me to snatch one end of the problem and decided to work on Lane Detection and Obstacle Elimination problem. It was because in my summer project I applied some basic processes of image processing and vision on Torch. As the work kicked off, the vision team revised some basics of OpenCV, installations, etc. For a couple of weeks, we worked on a sample IGVC lane video, only to get introduced to the drawbacks of using heuristic methods. We realized that we should stop checking Hit-and-Trial approach in such problems. One of the cons of using only heuristic approaches was that one could easily find several cases where it won’t work and in practicality, it obviously didn’t. Actually, for us realizing that solution of this problem using any obvious approach won’t work was tough but necessary. We needed to grasp some common theoretical concepts of computer vision, so we watched video tutorials of Prof. Mubarak Shah, UCF on YouTube. Most of our failed attempts were already described there as for why don’t they work and what more should be done. In practical testing at open environments, we got introduced to problems of changing weather conditions, soil patches, non-uniform grass, rough terrains, camera height, etc. Due to increased complexity, we were constrained to limited directions to think for the solution so that we don’t waste much time on an approach sure to fail. Not always one should search for an ultimate and easy solution to a tough problem because if the final solution has to get simplified it would automatically be done. A way to note down information to be extracted from lane video was to think how a human brain solves such a problem and what the input it remembers to return lane direction is. Often we used to read previously worked approaches on similar problems rather than always thinking from scratch. Documenting these approaches was an important task as weeks or months later we may want to know what we did. A good method was to neatly code it into functions so that directly loading the required library was sufficient to get their access. It also makes the code pretty understandable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem was obstacle detection. Blacking out some foreign color or some linear combination of several color components used to severely fail here returning false obstacles and hence cropping out some lane data. In order to tackle out this problem, we managed to incorporate LiDAR laser scan data. This gave us access to easily discriminate obstacles in the camera frame. Our final obstacle elimination algorithm was hence pretty much reliable as it would precisely crop out the obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a team member of IGVC has taught me a lot of things. Most important being Time Management. It was almost daily I used to wake up in the morning and note down a scheduled checklist for the whole day. One could hardly waste any time in such a situation. As one amongst 17 team members, it was the first time I got the opportunity to work in such large team. It is always a persistent experience working in such an enthusiastic environment. Thinking about how to approach a problem taught me that why sometimes intuition fails. It is because we don’t have the idea of all the problems one could face while approaching that problem or falsely simplifying it. As Einstein quoted, “Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.” If we realize that the solution to a problem won’t be easy, generally it doesn’t help to think from scratch. There are vast sources on the internet about such problems, people brainstorming on forums and research papers. Spending time wisely to read these materials always provides us with an offset edge as we get to know from where to start. So, our vision problem, in the end, wasn’t actually a coding problem but an algorithmic problem. Directly jumping on writing codes, debugging, etc. just to result in a failed attempt is nothing worth more than just a waste of time. Seniors and Professors were very helpful in the whole journey, and every member of the Team IGVC has been a source of motivation for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these four years, not every student may get to apply things taught in his/her coursework. In Team IGVC one could learn anything helpful, see if it could work and apply it. The experience of the things going right according to your way is always satisfying. Not always do things work, so keep the morale high. In Elon Musk’s words, “If something is important enough, even if the odds are against you, you should still do it.” The first step is to establish that something is possible, then probability will occur.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pritesh Kumbhare, EE, Y15</name></author><summary type="html">Most of my robotics experience came from my involvement in Team IGVC last year. Recruited as a member of Team Robocon, we shifted to IGVC in October due to conflicting competition dates of the former. You can read about IGVC and its objective on its official website www.igvc.org.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A different take on Robotics</title><link href="http://students.iitk.ac.in/roboclub/2017/09/25/A-different-take-on-Robotics.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A different take on Robotics" /><published>2017-09-25T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2017-09-25T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://students.iitk.ac.in/roboclub/2017/09/25/A%20different%20take%20on%20Robotics</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://students.iitk.ac.in/roboclub/2017/09/25/A-different-take-on-Robotics.html">&lt;p&gt;Robotics always brings our attention to programming and electronics.However, equally important is  the mechanical aspects of the robot, which is the first step towards good and effective robotics.In the following article, I would like to support my statement  by sharing one of my memories.The best experience I have had till date is my involvement in Robocon in my first year at IIT Kanpur.I consider myself honoured and very lucky to be part of this great team and the great things we achieved together.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;(Go through the Robocon 2016 problem statement to further improve your reading experience)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all started in September 2015 when we had the recruitment of first yearites.It was one of the first inductions into a team of IITK for our batch, so there was a lot of buzz and a large number of people turned up for the tests. Somehow, I managed to clear the tests and interviews and that was the beginning of something special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first month was dedicated to train us,the new members to specialize in one of the three fields-design and manufacturing,electronics and coding.So, I took up the first one and learnt SolidWorks and AutoCAD, which helped us to convert our ideas into viable designs.We also got to know about some basic manufacturing techniques like cutting(using Hacksaw as well as Waterjet),turning, milling,filing,drilling and tapping,etc . We had several brainstorming sessions where our seniors taught us how to approach designing a robot with an engineering common sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The winter was when we started working towards the problem statement. I was mostly involved with the hybrid robot . In designing so, we faced many challenges.Since, it was manually driven for some part of the circuit,we had to consider drivability and maneuverability.Since the robot had to be equipped with a lot other electronics sensors and boards, we needed to have a good space management to have good weight balance. So, we came up  with a double decker,  rear wheel drive chassis which turned employing the  differential drive.The toughest problem was the robot had to climb a pole.So, we planned to have an open structure so that the pole could enter from one side.Then we placed 3 pneumatic pistons ,whose ends were equipped with three motor-powered wheels.The idea was so that when the pistons actuated , the wheels would press against the pole and the motor would power the wheels to climb up. This simple idea had many unforeseen problems,which we discovered subsequently as we built and tested prototypes.This was the classic case of difference between what is theory (which was governed by our codes ) and what actually happens in practice(the electeonics and chassis capabilities).  Firstly, the pneumatic system was so powerful that it distorted the whole chassis to such an extent that it would fail after a few cycles of climbing. So, we redesigned the chassis with further reinforcements and included a locking mechanism so that the chassis would become a closed structure once the pole had entered to the middle of the robot.Another problem we faced was ,due to slight mis-alignment of pole-climbing wheels, the robot would rotate, tilt or even slip while climbing, which created further problems in placing the flag at the top.We tackled this problem with a novel idea of using wheels which had curvature same as that of the pole. This considerably improved the contact patch and solved the previous problems to a great extent, if not completely.In January, we decided to build a final chassis since a lot of testing and changes had gone to the initial chassis and it was starting to suffer cracks and fatigue. It was classic clockwork and we built the second chassis within 4-5 days.By the end of February , we could complete the problem statement consistently below 90 seconds on our practice arena.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team was always one of the respectable ones but we lacked bits and pieces,here and there which never made us a strong contenders for the win in the past. But this time,we left for Pune with very high hopes,owing to all the hardwork we had put in in past 4 months and the fact that we had completed the problem statement with such precision ,perhaps, for the first time.But when we reached the arena, we were robbed of our sleep when we saw some of the teams outperformed us in the practice sessions.We had no plans of giving up and we worked almost all the time for a couple of days.We changed our stratergies, changed a few design aspects , and dealt with a few teething issues on the way and reduced our total time to around 60 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From  outclassing some of the lightweights in the early stages to beating some big teams narrowly, we found our hardwork finally showing up at the main stage and that pure joy can’t be expressed in words.We had to face the best team in the semifinal and so we set up our robot on the limits ,and wished for a small mistake from rivals to pounce upon.We eventually ended up third, as we lost the semi-finals,but it was close and could have gone either way.The loss was bitter but we knew, we had extracted every bit of performance our chassis had on offer.The positives overshadowed the pain of loss and it only increased the hunger to build upon this success next time around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I repeat, I was lucky to be a part of this team and meet such seniors and alumnis who helped me all along the journey and helped the team progress in the right direction.It was a lovely experience where one could witness all sorts of emotions,the way we handled pressure ,worked in harmony. Such strong was the spirit inside the team,the passion and commitment everyone showed in the team was just unreal, and everyone of us still feels proud to say “Robocon is Love, Robocon is Life”.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Abhishek Sahoo</name></author><summary type="html">Robotics always brings our attention to programming and electronics.However, equally important is the mechanical aspects of the robot, which is the first step towards good and effective robotics.In the following article, I would like to support my statement by sharing one of my memories.The best experience I have had till date is my involvement in Robocon in my first year at IIT Kanpur.I consider myself honoured and very lucky to be part of this great team and the great things we achieved together.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Robotics Club Why it exists?</title><link href="http://students.iitk.ac.in/roboclub/2017/09/07/Robotics-Club-Why-it-exists.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Robotics Club Why it exists?" /><published>2017-09-07T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2017-09-07T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://students.iitk.ac.in/roboclub/2017/09/07/Robotics%20Club:%20Why%20it%20exists</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://students.iitk.ac.in/roboclub/2017/09/07/Robotics-Club-Why-it-exists.html">&lt;p&gt;The whitewashed room in Hall of Residence- II, equipped with big machines and conference tables, was designed a long time ago to cater to the needs of tinkering minds in the Institute. A lot of efforts by the students and alumni have gone into ensuring that this room, which belongs to the Robotics Club, would be a place where people would come together to explore new projects and test their ideas. Such is the motto of the Science and Technology Council as well, of which the club has been a part of its existence.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robotics Club became a name I began to closely associate myself with when I started working on the project &lt;a href=&quot;https://auviitk.com&quot;&gt;Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)&lt;/a&gt; in my freshman year. Compared to the other ongoing projects at that time such as SAE and RoboCon, it was the lesser sibling in terms of how developed the project was, however the opportunity to work with like minded people is what drew me to this project. After spending close to three years on it, working with the team has been one of the greatest experiences for me in the Institute. The final working system &lt;strong&gt;Varun&lt;/strong&gt;, maturing from an initial sketch on a piece of paper, marks a journey of tenacity and grit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to many freshmen who want to work on a project, one of the toughest decisions is to decide what you want to work on. In the plethora of options that were available to me at the start, I eventually decided to work on the mechanical aspects of the project because I felt I was more adept at such a work. With time and experience, I was able to mature upon what I really wanted to work in on a long- run. A suggestion: If one is to make a rough choice on what appeals to him or her, instead of blindly following the crowd a better approach is the one based on intuition. Ask yourself, “If I have to solve a particular problem, would I try to resolve it at the software end or at the hardware end?” With the answer to this itself, you should have your options reduced by half and things should become a bit clearer for you. However, this is just to help in making an initial decision quickly and allow you to start working on a project instead of wasting your time procrastinating. What is most important is that you develop the right attitude, and admit a sense of responsibility and enjoyment in the work you are doing, because eventually, everything else falls into the picture rightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the opportunity to develop technical skills, the way the club runs and the kind of ecology that is present helps you in enhancing your soft skills. One of the now-graduated seniors once told me, “I would always be a great team player but I would need to work hard to become a good leader.” He was right to a large extent. The initial time, when the responsibility to lead the AUV team was passed on to me, I was all over the place trying to manage my own priorities and a team that had expanded its numbers. It took a while but thanks to the constant feedback I received from my seniors and my teammates, we managed to pull out of the mess that had been created. Experiences like these are only possible when you are working on a large project and are in it for a long time. You learn to collaborate on projects and value people for their ideas irrespective of how absurd they may sound. Robotics, as it is now seen as, is a demanding inter-disciplinary field and requires one to know about various aspects of mechanical, electronics, and software engineering; even patiently listening to other person’s problems help you widen your understanding of their field, and certainly engraves a deeper respect to the challenges in engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quoting an excerpt from Steve Jobs’s commencement speech at Stanford University, “You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.” His words succinctly describe how I feel about this journey right now. What distinguishes working on projects in the club from the kind of exposure you get while working on a project with a professor is the level of maturity and independence you gain, and the kind of connections you get to make. One thing that I have realized as a member of the club is that most of the people who join in the projects are the go-getters in life, that is they end up pursuing something different from the crowd. To a large extent, I feel that the club helps in ensuring this difference and working with such people always bring a lot of humility and gratification. The club essentially serves as a platform to create bonds- with professors, seniors, your batchmates, and your juniors- that you would surely recognize once you graduate from the Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mayankm96/Mayankm96.github.io/master/images/team.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;AUV Team&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project AUV, which started off small, has grown over the years, just like the many long-term projects that are there in the club right now. It takes a few years to do that but in the end, it is all worth it. Thus, if you have a certain idea that you want to work on, then all you need is honest perseverance and the will to want to try it out relentlessly. You may always feel free to contact the club members to discuss it; in fact most people associated with the club love having an intellectual decisions on an idea and such discussions are, in general, encouraged provided you have done a bit of ‘research’ on your own before wanting to jump onto the implementing stage impulsively. It is always easy to start working on a project on anything but the enriching journey from a raw idea to an end- product is what working in the club is all about. I hope that the club becomes a home to its new members as it has been for me for all my stay at the Institute.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mayank Mittal</name></author><summary type="html">The whitewashed room in Hall of Residence- II, equipped with big machines and conference tables, was designed a long time ago to cater to the needs of tinkering minds in the Institute.

&lt;p&gt;This blog post is about my experience while developing a C++ library for motion
planning during my third year “internship”. This is about how after failing to
secure an internship for summers, I try to rescue my self-confidence by taking up
an ambitious summer project. Going in a direction orthogonal to what was
planned and finally making something I am proud of. This is both, my
experiences and a very short introduction to the library I developed.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost an year ago from now (03-07-2017 11:10 PM), the beginning of the
summer break, I was at one of the lowest points during my stay at IIT Kanpur. I
had applied to only three companies for internship through the SPO and was not
able to secure an internship since two of them decided to not take any student
and was rejected by the third after an interview. Looking back at that time is
amusing now and often forms the larger part of all the internship/placement
fundae that I give to my juniors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To utilize my summer productively, I decided to work on a project with
&lt;a href=&quot;http://home.iitk.ac.in/~dasgupta/&quot;&gt;Dr. Bhaskar Dasgupta&lt;/a&gt; who was the then faculty advisor of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://students.iitk.ac.in/robocon/&quot;&gt;Robocon Team&lt;/a&gt;. We
decided to work on a project that we had talked about earlier during one of the
Robocon team meetings. The project was to build a robot which could navigate in
an unknown environment, build maps and do some form of path planning (It was not the good ol’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping&quot;&gt;SLAM&lt;/a&gt; problem, trust me :-P). I was excited and overwhelmed at the same time. The task seemed insurmountable and there was so much to learn.
I spent some time reading random stuff from the internet and after another
meeting with my mentor, we decided that for the moment I should study and
implement some path planning algorithms and we would decide how to go ahead
at a later stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;blog-image&quot; style=&quot;width: ;&quot;&gt;
	
  		&lt;img class=&quot;blog-img&quot; src=&quot;http://students.iitk.ac.in/roboclub/blog/images/mpl-map.bmp&quot; alt=&quot;Illustration 1: This is what I mean by a 'map'.

obstacles and white denotes the free region&quot; /&gt;

Nothing fancy, just a bitmap where black denotes
obstacles and white denotes the free region&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, I studied a few standard
motion planning algorithms and started
thinking of how to simulate them. At
this point, I must admit the MATLAB is
not one of my favourites and I always
try to find a reason for using C++. This
was the perfect opportunity since I
could not find a simple framework to
simulate these algorithms and I admit
that I did not try hard enough (or try at
all! ). I convinced myself that this task
was too computationally intensive to be
handled by python and the only option I had was to use C++. I ended up writing about 200 lines of code to display a minimal (ugly) GUI which allowed the user to
load a map (Illustration 1) and select the starting and ending points for
computing the path and the program would then show an animation of the
planning algorithm finding the path. I showed it to my mentor, he liked it and
encouraged me to simulate another algorithm. This time, I decided, as any good
software engineer would do, that I should divide my program into modules which
share their functionality instead of replicating the code for every simulation I
make. It was this second simulation which changed the direction of my summer
project altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I had now completely forgotten about the original problem
statement and was focusing on problems like: How to factor out the pathplanning
algorithms into composable components? What are the basic
components of a path planning problem? What would a sensible API for path
planning look like? I tackled these questions for 5-6 weeks while writing some
prototypes, making flowcharts etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was brainstorming on the design of this library, I would think of the
behavior of each of the component on an algorithm, does it form a logical entity?
What behaviors of the component to hide and what to expose to the user? Are
the classes in this code a good representation of the objects in real world? I do
not remember what all were the ideas I came up with since it has been almost an
year since I started working on it but what I do remember is how after several
weeks I was finally happy with the design after about 5 complete rewrites of the
entire code (over ~1.5k lines of code). Here is the structure I came up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;blog-image&quot; style=&quot;width: ;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workspace contains the map of the environment. I defined it as a separate class
so that it is possible to hide the implementation from other modules. Problem
definition contains start and end points at the moment. It can be extended to
incorporate way-points or other path constraints that the user might be interested
in. The graph builder takes a workspace and discards all the information not
required for planning the path thus forming a good representation of the
workspace. The graph search algorithm searches this graph for paths which are
then interpolated using the interpolator to generate smooth paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t go more into the library in this post since the library has some
documentation at &lt;a href=&quot;http://lakshayg.github.io/mpel/&quot;&gt;lakshayg.github.io/mpel&lt;/a&gt;. The source code for this library is
available on GitHub at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lakshayg/mpel&quot;&gt;github.com/lakshayg/mpel&lt;/a&gt;. I would recommend you to
visit the link and have a look at the library and feel free to make changes and
contribute to the code. I close this post with some examples of paths generated
using different path planning algorithms:&lt;/p&gt;
