A lot of efforts by the students and alumni have gone into ensuring that this room, which belongs to the Robotics Club, would be a place where people would come together to explore new projects and test their ideas. Such is the motto of the Science and Technology Council as well, of which the club has been a part since its existence.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robotics Club became a name I began to closely associate myself with, when I started working on the project &lt;a href=&quot;https://auviitk.com&quot;&gt;Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)&lt;/a&gt; in my freshman year. Compared to the other ongoing projects at that time such as SAE and RoboCon, it was the lesser sibling in terms of how developed the project was, however the opportunity to work with like minded people is what drew me to this project. After spending close to three years on it, working with the team has been one of the greatest experiences for me in the institute. The final working system &lt;strong&gt;Varun&lt;/strong&gt;, maturing from an initial sketch on a piece of paper, marks a journey of tenacity and grit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to many freshmen who want to work on a project, one of the toughest decisions is to decide what you want to work on. In the plethora of options that were available to me at the start, I eventually decided to work on the mechanical aspects of the project because I felt I was more adept to such a work. With time and experience I was able to mature upon what I really wanted to work in on a long- run. A suggestion: If one is to make a rough choice on what appeals to him or her, instead of blindly following the crowd a better approach is the one based on intuition. Ask yourself, “If I have to solve a particular problem, would I try to resolve it at the software end or at the hardware end?” With the answer to this itself, you should have your options reduced by half and things should become a bit clearer for you. However, this is just to help in making an initial decision quickly and allow you to start working on a project instead of wasting your time procrastinating. What is most important is that you develop the right attitude, and admit a sense of responsibility and enjoyment in the work you are doing, because eventually everything else falls into the picture rightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the opporutnity to develop technical skills, the way the club runs and the kind of ecology that is present helps you in enhancing your soft skills. One of the now-graduated seniors once told me, “I would always be a great team player but I would need to work hard to become a good leader.” He was right to a large extent. The initial time, when the responsibilty to lead the AUV team was passed on to me, I was all over the place trying to manage my own priorities and a team that had expanded its numbers. It took a while but thanks to the constant feedback I recieved from my seniors and my teammates, we managed to pull out of the mess that had been created. Experiences like these are only possible when you are working in a large project and are in it for a long time. You learn to collaborate on projects, and value people for their ideas irrespective of how absurd they may sound. Robotics, as it is now seen as, is a demanding inter-disciplinary field and requires one to know about various aspects of mechanical, electronics, and software engineering; even patiently listening to other person’s problems help you widen your understanding of their field, and certainly engraves a deeper respect to the challenges in engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quoting an excerpt from Steve Jobs’s commencement speech at Stanford University, “You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.” His words succinctly describes how I feel about this journey right now. What distinguishes working on projects in the club from the kind of exposure you get while working on a project with a professor is the level of maturity and independence you gain, and the kind of connections you get to make. One thing that I have realised as a member of the club is that most of the people who join in the projects are the go-getters in life, that is they end up persuing something different from the crowd. To a large extent I feel that the club helps in ensuring this difference and working with such people always bring a lot of humility and gratification. The club essentially serves as a platform to create bonds- with professors, seniors, your batchmates and your juniors- that you would surely recognize once you graduate from the institute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/Mayankm96/Mayankm96.github.io/raw/master/images/team.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;AUV Team&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project AUV, which started off small, has grown over the years, just like the many long-term projects that are there in the club right now. It takes a few years to do that but in the end it is all worth it. Thus, if you have a certain idea that you want to work on, then all you need is honest persevearance and the will to want to try it out relentlessly. You may always feel free to contact the club members to talk about; in fact most people associated with the club love having an intellectual decisions on an idea and such discussions are encouraged provided you have done a bit of ‘researh’ on your own before wanting to jump onto the implementing stage impulsely. It is always easy to start working on a project on anything but the enriching journey from a raw idea to an end- product is what working in the club is all about. I hope that the club becomes a home to its new members as it has been for me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mayank Mittal</name></author><summary type="html">The whitewashed room in Hall of Residence- II, equipped with big machines and conference tables, was designed a long time ago to cater to the needs of tinkering minds in the institute.

&lt;p&gt;This blog post is about my experience while developing a C++ library for motion
planning during my third year “internship”. This is about how after failing to
secure an internship for summers, I try to rescue my self-confidence by taking up
an ambitious summer project. Going in a direction orthogonal to what was
planned and finally making something I am proud of. This is both, my
experiences and a very short introduction to the library I developed.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost an year ago from now (03-07-2017 11:10 PM), the beginning of the
summer break, I was at one of the lowest points during my stay at IIT Kanpur. I
had applied to only three companies for internship through the SPO and was not
able to secure an internship since two of them decided to not take any student
and was rejected by the third after an interview. Looking back at that time is
amusing now and often forms the larger part of all the internship/placement
fundae that I give to my juniors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To utilize my summer productively, I decided to work on a project with
&lt;a href=&quot;http://home.iitk.ac.in/~dasgupta/&quot;&gt;Dr. Bhaskar Dasgupta&lt;/a&gt; who was the then faculty advisor of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://students.iitk.ac.in/robocon/&quot;&gt;Robocon Team&lt;/a&gt;. We
decided to work on a project that we had talked about earlier during one of the
Robocon team meetings. The project was to build a robot which could navigate in
an unknown environment, build maps and do some form of path planning (It was not the good ol’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping&quot;&gt;SLAM&lt;/a&gt; problem, trust me :-P). I was excited and overwhelmed at the same time. The task seemed insurmountable and there was so much to learn.
I spent some time reading random stuff from the internet and after another
meeting with my mentor, we decided that for the moment I should study and
implement some path planning algorithms and we would decide how to go ahead
at a later stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;blog-image&quot; style=&quot;width: ;&quot;&gt;

Nothing fancy, just a bitmap where black denotes
obstacles and white denotes the free region&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, I studied a few standard
motion planning algorithms and started
thinking of how to simulate them. At
this point, I must admit the MATLAB is
not one of my favourites and I always
try to find a reason for using C++. This
was the perfect opportunity since I
could not find a simple framework to
simulate these algorithms and I admit
that I did not try hard enough (or try at
all! ). I convinced myself that this task
was too computationally intensive to be
handled by python and the only option I had was to use C++. I ended up writing about 200 lines of code to display a minimal (ugly) GUI which allowed the user to
load a map (Illustration 1) and select the starting and ending points for
computing the path and the program would then show an animation of the
planning algorithm finding the path. I showed it to my mentor, he liked it and
encouraged me to simulate another algorithm. This time, I decided, as any good
software engineer would do, that I should divide my program into modules which
share their functionality instead of replicating the code for every simulation I
make. It was this second simulation which changed the direction of my summer
project altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I had now completely forgotten about the original problem
statement and was focusing on problems like: How to factor out the pathplanning
algorithms into composable components? What are the basic
components of a path planning problem? What would a sensible API for path
planning look like? I tackled these questions for 5-6 weeks while writing some
prototypes, making flowcharts etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was brainstorming on the design of this library, I would think of the
behavior of each of the component on an algorithm, does it form a logical entity?
What behaviors of the component to hide and what to expose to the user? Are
the classes in this code a good representation of the objects in real world? I do
not remember what all were the ideas I came up with since it has been almost an
year since I started working on it but what I do remember is how after several
weeks I was finally happy with the design after about 5 complete rewrites of the
entire code (over ~1.5k lines of code). Here is the structure I came up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;blog-image&quot; style=&quot;width: ;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workspace contains the map of the environment. I defined it as a separate class
so that it is possible to hide the implementation from other modules. Problem
definition contains start and end points at the moment. It can be extended to
incorporate way-points or other path constraints that the user might be interested
in. The graph builder takes a workspace and discards all the information not
required for planning the path thus forming a good representation of the
workspace. The graph search algorithm searches this graph for paths which are
then interpolated using the interpolator to generate smooth paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t go more into the library in this post since the library has some
documentation at &lt;a href=&quot;http://lakshayg.github.io/mpel/&quot;&gt;lakshayg.github.io/mpel&lt;/a&gt;. The source code for this library is
available on GitHub at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lakshayg/mpel&quot;&gt;github.com/lakshayg/mpel&lt;/a&gt;. I would recommend you to
visit the link and have a look at the library and feel free to make changes and
contribute to the code. I close this post with some examples of paths generated
using different path planning algorithms:&lt;/p&gt;
